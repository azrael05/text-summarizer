There are various ways of doing Abstractive Summarization, in-fact there are citations written on the number of ways of doing it. But we are not going to mention all those here, because if we do so then this article itself will need a summarization!! \ud83d\ude1c\n\nWe have used HuggingFace\u2019s Transformers library to perform abstractive summarization. Transformers provide us with thousands of pre-trained models, which can be used for text summarization as well as for a wide variety of NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, translation, speech recognition, optical character recognition etc."}, "2": {"role": "assistant", "content": "We have used HuggingFace\u2019s Transformers library to perform abstractive summarization .
